## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lecture-management-system.git
   cd lecture-management-system
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a Firebase project:
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Create a new project
   - Enable Authentication with Email/Password
   - Create a Firestore database
   - Create a Storage bucket
   - Get your Firebase configuration

4. Set up Firebase configuration:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory
   - Add your Firebase configuration to the `.env` file using the following format:
     ```
     VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
     VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project_id.firebaseapp.com
     VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
     VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project_id.appspot.com
     VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
     VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
     VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id
     ```
   - Note: The `.env` file is excluded from git to protect your API keys and sensitive information

5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Firebase Security Rules

Make sure to set up the following security rules in your Firebase console:

### Firestore Rules
```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow authenticated users to read all documents
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Allow authenticated users to create and update lectures
    match /lectures/{lectureId} {
      allow create, update: if request.auth != null;
      allow delete: if request.auth != null && (
        // Allow admins to delete any lecture
        get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin' ||
        // Allow users to delete their own lectures
        resource.data.uploadedBy == request.auth.uid
      );
    }
    
    // Allow admins to manage users
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
      allow update, delete: if request.auth != null && 
        get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin';
    }
  }
}
```

### Storage Rules
```
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    // Allow read access to all authenticated users
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Allow write access to the lectures folder for authenticated users
    match /lectures/{fileName} {
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```
